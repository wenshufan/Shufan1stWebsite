    <h3> The Website for Education Professionals </h3>
    <p><strong> In Spring 2014, </strong> our client, Bob, an entrepreneur, came to us and ask us to redesign his website, Planet News and Views. The goal of this website is to provide a educational platform to connect K-12 teachers and students all over the world. However, the contents were complicated since the site involved in many fields in education. Bob knew it was outdated and not user friendly, and the sign-up rate from new users was low. He found he needs help from UX experts. </p>
    <p> One of my teammates, Allan was Bob's friend. He brought up the idea that we should look into this site and see if we could help Bob. Our team agreed.</p>
    <p> I pick this project because it was a website to serve K-12 teachers and students. Since I was a middle school language teacher before, I had the understanding of the school administrative system and teachers' needs to find a way to approach this project.</p>
    <img class="align-right" src="Images/Projects/PNV/BB.png" alt="BlackBoard Website screenshot."/>
    <p> First, our team did a competitive analysis. I did competitive analysis on <a href="www.blackboard.com"> BlackBoard Inc</a>. BlackBoard Inc had a lot of online contents and and presented a lot of links on their homepage which confused me. But it was not to difficult to find a specific content I wanted to find. In other words, their information architecture was clearly well-designed, so I could find a specific item without too much trouble. However, the first sight of the web-page was very confusing, especially when I wanted to understand what this site was about in big picture. I suggested that we should have simple and clear webpages to start with, and provided users information about what our site was about (however, the second suggestion was somehow forgotten). Then we should use the user login to determine which content should be presented to the user to avoide confusion like BlackBoard did to me. (Note: BlackBoard had updated their website, so the old version as shown in screen shot does not exist anymore.)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> Create the User Survey</h3>
    <p> In order to know our users well, I worked with my teammates to create a survey for our users -- education professionals. Our goal was to find out what these education professionals wanted to use this site for. We sent out the survey to 2,267 professionals, 206 opened the email, and 46 replied. We received good data for our design decision. </p>
    <p> The survey brought in a lot of information: user goals and expectation, and needs for this website. We did card sort on all the information we collected from the survey. </p>
    <img class="align-right" src="Images/Projects/PNV/CS.png" alt="Card sort of our survey results."/>
    <p> The survey revealed user background: Our users were very interested in using website to connect with other teaching professionals in the world. Besides, these education professionals had used websites to assist their teaching very often. Language teachers shown the strongest desire to use websites like PNV in their classes. In addition, librarians had the highest rates of using websites as one of their educational tools because they had to discover new tech resources for their schools to improve teaching efficiency.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> Personas </h3>
    <p> According to our survey results, we created our personas. </p>
    <h4> Primary Persona 1: Sarah, the Spanish Teacher</h4>
    <p> I drafted the story of this primary persona since I was a language teacher myself. I understood that most language teacher wanted to have her students connected with students from the area which speak their target languages. Survey data provided me efficient material for other items than the story when I drafted this persona up.</p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/P1.png" alt="Primary persona Sarah."/> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> Primary Persona 2: Lauren, the Librarian.</h4>
    <p> Our other primary persona was Lauren, who represents a typical group of librarians whose job was to help teachers to find teaching resources. Moreover, they were the gateway to new technoloty teaching resources.</p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/P2.png" alt="Primary persona Lauren."/> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> Secondary Persona: Phil, the Physics Teacher</h4>
    <p> We created Phil from our survey results. Our survey shown that science teachers used online teaching resources often, even though they did not use it as often as the language teachers did. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/P3.png" alt="Secondary persona Phil."/> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Determine the Information Architecture (IA)</h3>
    <p> After determing our personas, we started to brain storm on how we should arrange our IA and fit in so many contents without confusing the user. </p>
    <p> I always tell myself to keep user goals in mind when arranging our website IA. However, with a huge contents to fit in, it is challenging to arrange the site by ourselves. We asked our users to do card-sorting for us on <a href="http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm"> Optimal Sort </a>. </p>
    <P> One thing I found out about to have your users doing card sort for you was that, many users abandoned the card sorting without finishing it since they could not figure out how to finish the task, especially those users who were not technical. We ended up meeting our users in person or talking with them on phone to assist them through out the task. </P>
    <p> Here I want to thank my friend Li Rizal for taking time to finish cardsort for me. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/IADiscussion.png" alt="We are discussing the IA."/> <br>
    <p> The card sorting result was very interesting. 11 teachers who did card sorts shown very obvious pattern on which information should be put into which page. The result helped us a lot on making design decisions for PNV. </p>
    <p> After we did affinity test by using results from users' card sorts, then finally came out with the information diagram. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/IA.png" alt="The IA we came up with for new users."/> <br>
    <p> We took out all critical goals of users from our survey, narrowed down categories, and reduced the duplications, and finally came up with a clear direction on how we should arrange our IA. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h3> Sketches and Axure Prototypes </h3>
    <p> After determined the IA, we finally can start our design. I sketched my idea about the homepage, global news and connect to others page. Sketch was a quick way to communicate with my teammates on my ideas.</p>
    <p>I sketched the homepage. I believed this page should be responsive, so teachers and students could access by using tablets and touch screen. Every button should be in easy-to-touch size, and provided them easy use even when accessed through small screen devises.</p>
    <p> Since not all of our targeted audience could have access to American social network applications such as Facebook, Tweeter, and Pinterest, I put "share on socialnetwork" links down in the middle instead of the top.</p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/Sketch3.png" alt="My sketch for the homepage."/>
    <p> Our designated designer, Denise, took some idea of my homepage sketch to put a slide bar in the middle of the homepage. Then she converted into our homepage prototype in Axure.</p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/PNV3.png" alt="My sketch for the homepage."/>
    <p>Then I sketched the page which teachers would use to connect other teachers in the world. In the design of this page, I put a globe in the middle which the teachers can spin and find out how many connections PNV provided in the region they look for. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/Sketch2.png" alt="My sketch for the Connecting with other Teacher page."/>
    <p>My teammates liked my sketch, especially the spinning globe. They asked me to convert it into Axure. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/PNV2.png" alt="My Axure prototype for thesketch for the Connecting with other Teacher page."/>
    <p>The other page I sketched was the Planet News page. It was a page where teachers and students could post news related to their own country and give comments and discussion about it.</p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/Sketch1.png" alt="My sketch for the Planet News page."/>
    <p> In default, the newest post would be on the top row. Teachers and students could customize which kind of news they would like to read in this page. My idea was that user could spin this columns up and down to find topics they like. Users could click to read the detail of the news and commonts from others in which they were interested in. The right column was for news feed, the teacher or student can find out their friends' posts there. </p>
    <p> My teammates liked my idea, so I made an Axure page according to my sketch. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/PNV1.png" alt="My Axure prototype for the Planet News page."/>
    <p> Later on, we put together everyone's Axure pages together, and move to the next step: usability study!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Usability Study</h3>
    <p>After having our prototype, we found the challenging thing to do next is recruiting. It was a little bit difficult to recruit our targeted users--teachers and librarians. I was able to find several teacher friends who were our targeted users through my connection, but it was hard to find strangers who was willing to do the test. Since participants were my friends, I avoided being the moderator, but the helper, observer and note taker. In the end, I analyzed our study results since I was in all studies but one.</p>
    <p> Here I want to thank all my teacher friends, Lynne, Annie, and Jenny, who participated the study for spending their precious time with us. The study took about 1 hour, and they all were willing to talk to us after the study on how we should improve our website. Thank you all! </p>
    <img class="align-right" src="Images/Projects/PNV/PNV4.png" alt="The teacher is doing our usability study."/>
    <p> We had 3 teachers and 1 librarian to participated the study for us. The result helped us tremendously in iteration. Here were some major points: </p>
    <p> <strong> All participants liked the clear arrangement of the complex content. </strong> All participants told us that they liked the arrangement of pages and informations of this site once they understood what PNV was about. We were happy about this finding since we spent a lot of time researching and arranging the IA.</p>
    <p> <strong> The goal and purpose of this site was not clear. </strong> Since there was no website like PNV to promote connection between education professionals in the world, our participants could not understand what this website was about by looking at our homepage at the first sight. They spent quite sometime to figure it out, and was confused for the very first 10 minutes. In the result analysis, I stressed it was a priority for us to make it easy for users to understand what PNV is about again. </p>
    <p> In order to solve this problem, we added a page called "About Us" to explain what PNV was and how it worked to built up the connection among education professionals in the world.</p>
    <p> <strong> Sign-up button was hard to discover. </strong> After viewing the page, our participants had problem finding out where to sign up. It was a critical problem since our stakeholder wanted to have a higher sign-up rate. We added a prominent yellow button in the homepage to encourage teachers to sign up. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Work in Progress </h3>
    <p> This project was for our class use, but it is also a continuing work with our stakeholder. In the end of the quarter, we revised our prototype for our final presentation. We added a prominent sign-up button, a banner on the bottom of each slides to explain the purpose of this site, and a tutorial where users can click and see how to use this site. </p>
    <img class="large" src="Images/Projects/PNV/PNV5.png" alt="PNV homepage."/>
    <p> However, it is an ongoing project we are still working on. Bob was very happy with our prototype, and had asked his developers to revise PNV website according to our design. They are testing it and see how their existing users' feedback about it.</p>
    <p> I will update it once I hear from him. Thank you for viewing! </p>
