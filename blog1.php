    <h2>About My Website!</h2>
    <img class="headshot" src="Images/Blogs/Niu1.jpg" alt="Niu is 12!"/>
    <p>Super Ball is coming this Sunday! I feel very excited about the completion of my website and the coming of Super Ball! </p>
    <p>Also I am excited that I "almost" finished my website....It took me about 2 weeks.</p>
    <p>The funny part is that, after learning C# and experience the "harsh life" of a developer (please see my paper about "poor life of the developers" if you want to know about it), I realized HTML4, PHP, and CSS are much more human friendly! That is, building up a website without database is easy comparing to the one with database. In addition, the tools are much user friendly to use than Visual studio and Eclipse.</p>
    <p>I should say I spend more time in the IA of this website than coding it out. It is also a try and error experience to code up such a small personal website, but I found I love doing it.</p>
    <p> Now I am collecting materials about the process of coding up my website (I dare not to say building up since I think the word "build up" belongs to developers). And I want to put the materials in my portfolio! </p>
    <p>I always want a blog, and tried WorldPress. But I found it is hard to customize it according to exactly what I want. I am now exploring ways to create my blog with my personal twist (such as with a lot of pink color...). </p>
    <p> Just let you know that I am still working on it... :D</p>

    <p>Thank you for viewing.</p>
