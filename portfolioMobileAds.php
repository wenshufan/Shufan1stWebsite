    <h2>Mobile Ads Experimental Research:<br>
      Best Location and Optimized Size for Ads on a Photo-based Mobile App</h2>
    <div class="shadowbox">
      <h3> Summary </h3>
      <p> <strong> Goal:</strong>Design an experimental research to find out which type/location of advertisement is effective without decreasing customer satisfaction too much.</p>
      <p><strong> Problem:</strong>Evaluate the relationship between type/location of the ads and customer satisfaction</p>
      <p><strong> Deliverable: </strong> A report with experimental lab research plan and effective statistical methodologies for analysis</p>
      <p><strong> My Role:</strong>Project Manager</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Literature review</li>
        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
        <li>Simplified fuzzy questions into actionable hypothesis</li>
        <li>Designed the within-subject experiment</li>
        <li>Determined statistical methods for data analysis </li>

    <h3>A Letter from the Stakeholder</h3>
    <p>Our imaginary stakeholder—the professor—wrote our team a letter. He wanted to add advertisement on his photo application on mobile phone to maximize the profit. However, he was wondering what was the maximized size and the best location for the advertisement.</p>
    <p>After our communication with the stakeholder, we did our initial research and literature review, and presented our initial thoughts in the class: </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Finding Variables</h3>
    <p>The second step was to decide what were the variables for the research. It was the most difficult part since we had to filter out all the possible variables from the fuzzy questions. We found there were not much information available for the size and location of advertisement on photo app.  We had to figure out all possibilities and listed them.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Narrow It down to Several Variables</h3>
    <p>We had another problem. 24 experiment was too much. The stakeholder said it was not possible carry out 24 researches owing to budget limits. He said he wanted to know results with only banner and static ads. If that was the case, we filtered out other variables into only 3.</p>

    <br>
    <h3> Finalized Plan </h3>
    <p> The stakeholder thought 3 variables were too few. He changed his mind and asked us to do inline advertisement as well. With anthropology background, I have no problem accepting change because I saw different ad presentations as nominal data. My team member, Zening, who was a computer science major, could not accept it. She would like to pull out every possible situations. In this situation, again, the variables became 48.</p>
    <p>The stakeholder decided that we should only discuss 3 kinds of advertisements: banner, integrated ads, and interstitial ads.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Research Methods</h3>
    <p> We decided to use QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction) to evaluate the advertisement satisfaction, and the recall rates for the effectiveness. Sample size was 36 targeted audience (young females) for the in-lab experiment.</p>

    <br>
    <h3> Preliminary Design </h3>
    <p> We decided to use Friedman test and Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon signed ranks test to calculate user satisfaction from the data from QUIS. Repeated measures logistic regression and Bonferroni-corrected McNemar test were used to examine the dichotomous recall data.
    <p>Our result shows that interstitials were the best choice for our stakeholder.</p>

    <p>Lesson learned: We have to consider many aspects when designing an experiment. A good communication with stakeholders was critical in our experiment process. </p>
