    <h2>Portfolio: Amazon Web Service Internship </h2>

    <p><strong> In Summer 2014</strong> I worked as a User Research Intern under AWS Console Team at AWS. It was a wonderful experience because I had a chance to be an independent user researcher under my mentor, Andrew, and manager, Jens', help. I had the chance to cooperate with fantastic UX designers for design iterations, work with the project manager to find out how to solve usability problem, and discuss with developers about possible/practical solutions. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> Worked as a sole researcher in real projects </h3>
    <p> I completed three projects and brought insights to design iteration. UX designers and project managers told me my reports were very helpful to them. In the end of my internship, I had the honor to present to the head of a service console and a team of developers, and my presentation was broadcasted to East coast Amazon locations in real time. </p>

    <p> I really enjoyed the UX research process! Most of my stakeholders are UX designers or project managers. After meeting with stakeholders and understood their needs in the kickoff meeting, I generated the research questions and scripts according to stakeholders' needs.</p>
    <p> Sometimes the UX designer would like me to do a study a prototype about a new design or a revised design, the designer can choose to send me the prototype or ask me to hook things up myself. I found my Axure skill is handy when the busy designer had to email me things and asked me to hook up for the study. Especially in the agile environment, sometimes I have to change the prototype between studies according to the feedback from previous participant, I found being able to produce a prototype in a short time is very useful. </p>
    <p> Recruiting participants in AWS is another interesting learning aspects. I learned there are efficient time spots during a day or a week to send out recruiting email, and a researcher should not send out recruiting emails during a certain time of the day since people are not going to read it. It is quite common for participants to cancel a study session a day before, but I realized that if I determine to find another participant in time, there is always a way to make it happen.</p>
    <p> I always felt privileged to use the usability lab in Amazon for studies. Amazon has great labs for usability study, but the equipment sometimes is hard to manage. Most of the time I used Webex and BlackMagic along with video and audio equipment in the lab for study.  One thing I found was essential for hosting a study was to arrive at least 1 hour before the study started to make sure everything was arranged. I was lucky enough that I did not have any technical problem during my internship. </p>
    <p> Carrying out usability study was extremely exciting. During studies, I practiced techniques on how to prompt participants to talk more about their experience during the session. Sometimes I had the advantage to use Mandarin when doing study with Chinese developers who tended not to talk a lot in English. They opened up in their mother tongue.</p>
    <p> Analyzed data was extremely challenging. Since there were 46 serves at the time I was doing my intern, it was very difficult for me to understand every service well in a very short period of time. When participants (who were all software developers) mention other services, I had to do some research on it to understand their answer. Most of the time I use Excel to analyze the data, and Adobe Premier to edit videos I recorded during the session. </p>

    <p> Conducting report and presenting to stakeholders were my favorite parts. Most stakeholders were too busy to participate the study session. So it is critical to present user pain points for stakeholders to understand how they should tackle the problem. The presentation was actually more like a discussion with stakeholders, and it is beneficial to learn from stakeholders' point of view as well. It was precious experience to understand both the stakeholders' point of view in order to tackle the problem to alleviate user pain together. </p>

    <p>In some projects, I had the honor to work with UX designers for design decisions. Under the agile working environment, I found working with UX designers for fast iteration is an efficient approach to get something move on quickly. </p>
    <p>Luckily in one project, I had to work like a project manager, took the responsibility of the service even though I was only an intern, and held up meetings to drive the iteration progress. </p>

    <h3>This internship taught me aspects I should work on in order to be a great UX professional </h3>
    <p> During the internship, I found developers' logic is different from UX professionals! Even though I am married to a developer and have a lot of developer friends, I had no idea what they do and could not understand their chats about work. Then I realized that I had very limited understanding about computational concepts to talk to them in "developers' language". As an anthropologist, in order to understand a certain kind of people, you have to "live their life". It is the main reason why I decided to get my hands dirty by developing Mobile Application by using C# in Autumn 2014. I gained a great insights on how they think and their development environment, and found myself be able to talk to my developer friends much easily.</p>
