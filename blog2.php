    <h2>Culture difference matters in app design!</h2>
    <figure>
    <img class="headshot" src="Images/Blogs/Me.jpg" alt="An image of me altered by using LineCamera"/>
    <figcaption> You may see this kind of "altered" picture everywhere in Asian websites. Asian girls like to alter selfies like this, and I am one of them :p </figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>I am from Taiwan, an island influenced by Japan, Korea, China, and the US culture.</p>
    <p>When I just come to the US, I always complain that I can not find things designed in my style: I want everything pink and cute.</p>
    <p>In Asia, Asian women have the right to use baby pink stuff. However, I found it is not the norm in the US. Pink is for young girls and babies. </p>
    <p>Thanks for the technology, Asian apps are available on Market Place right now!!!</p>
    <p>The other day when I was discussing culture influence in technology design, I shown them my lovely camera app: Line Camera! It is a very popular camera app Asian girls use.</p>
    <p>In order to demonstrate how to use it, we took the first picture in class.</p>
    <figure class="middle" >
    <img src="Images/Blogs/pic1.png" alt="Our first normal picture from my phone."/>  
    <figcaption> This is the original picture we took in class. Thanks Michael for taking it!</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> Then I started my magic by using LineCamera...</p>
    <p> First, I whiten and smoothen our skins, which is a standard procedure since Asians think pale skins are pretty.</p>
   
    <p>I am still working on this blog....More picture will come soon!</p>
